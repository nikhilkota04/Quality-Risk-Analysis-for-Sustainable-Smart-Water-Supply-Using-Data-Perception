# Quality-Risk-Analysis-for-Sustainable-Smart-Water-Supply-Using-Data-Perception

We the students who are a team of 3 people (R Sindhuja, KV Nikhil, GJ manikanta varma) did this project Quality Risk Analysis for Sustainable Smart Water Supply Using Data Perceptionas our academic major project. Constructing Sustainable Smart Water Supply systems is facing serious challenges all around the world with the fast expansion of modern cities. Water quality is influencing our life ubiquitously and prioritizing all urban management. 

Traditional urban water quality control mostly focused on routine tests of quality indicators, which include physical, chemical, and biological groups. However, the inevitable delay for biological indicators has increased the health risk and led to accidents such as massive infections in many big cities. 

In this paper, we provide a possible solution by building a risk analysis framework for the urban water supply system. It takes indicator data we collected from industrial processes to perceive water quality changes, and further for risk detection. In order to provide explainable results, we propose an Adaptive Frequency Analysis (Adp-FA) method to resolve the data using indicatorsâ€™ frequency domain information for their inner relationships and individual prediction. 

We employ the proposed method to test spectrogram, prediction accuracy, and time consumption, comparing with classical Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest methods.
